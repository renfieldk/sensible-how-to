How-to for first-time users of the Sensible framework

## Introduction
This is a simple how-to for those of you new to the Sensible framework.
It is a rather simple guide that will walk you through downloading and setting up Sensible, running some code, making some changes, and running some more code.
The core platform is based on open web standards, as championed by Mozilla.

## Who be you?
This is for the intrepid folk who know some html & css, perhaps some javascript, arguably familiar with the command-line, and chock full of curiosity.

## What you need?
A computer, a network (wifi works), a smarphone, an intertubes connection.

# To Begin
* Download and install Mozilla: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/
* Download and install Sensible: http://sensible.mono.hm/
* Unzip Sensible folder into someplace obvious, for example /user/renfield/
